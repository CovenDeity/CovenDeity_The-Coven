## Getting Started
1. **Read the Black Laws:**
   - All users must read and follow the [Black Laws](black-laws.md).
2. **Verification & Roles:**
   - Upon joining, users must pass **Wick** verification to receive the **Disciples** role.
   - Next, users must pass **Double Counter** verification to receive the **Awakened** role.
   - After both verifications, users are placed in the `#the-purgatory` channel (the waiting room) until a moderator (**Council** member) reviews them.
   - If approved by The Council, the user is assigned the **Annointed** role and granted full entry.
3. **Join the Conversation:**
   - Participate in channels organized under the **GATHERING CIRCLE** category.
4. **Respect The Council:**
   - Moderators, known as **The Council**, enforce the Black Laws and maintain order.
   - The Council's private discussions and decisions happen in the **THE ORDER** category.
5. **Bots and Automation:**
   - Bots in the server hold the **Familiars** role and help protect The Coven from alt and bot accounts.

## Administration Bots
- **Wick:** Advanced security bot for anti-raid, anti-alt, and server protection. Wick helps keep The Coven safe from unwanted accounts and raids.
- **Double Counter:** Verification bot that uses device fingerprinting to block alt accounts and ensure new members are legitimate. Double Counter adds an extra layer of security for Disciples joining The Coven.
