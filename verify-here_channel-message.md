> To step through the veil and join **The Coven**, you must bind your spirit through both separate seals **below**.
> Once both trials are met, a member of **The Council** will review your essence to determine your access to the inner sanctum.
> 1. **The First Seal (Wick):** Click the button to prove your soul is not a mere construct.
> 2. **The Second Seal (Double Counter):** Click the green light to ensure your path is true.
