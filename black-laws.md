# The Coven
### To keep our altar clean and our rituals focused, all initiates must adhere to the following Black Thread Laws.

## :scroll: The Shadow Decrees

### I. The Law of Sovereignty
Every soul within this circle is their own master.
Harassment, hate speech, or bigotry regarding race, gender, or identity is a violation of the pact.
Treat your fellow practitioners with the respect their spirit deserves.

### II. The Veiled Tongue
What is spoken within the stone walls stays within the stone walls.
Do not take screenshots or share the private workings of others.
Doxing is an immediate curse.

### III. The Order of Chaos
Do not clutter the scrying pools with repetitive incantations, excessive emojis, or unsolicited advertisements.
Keep your energy focused and your messages meaningful.

### IV. The Forbidden Arts
Keep the darker urges in check.
No sexually explicit content, gore, or discussions of illegal activities.

### V. The High Priest’s Word
The Council have the final word on all disputes.
If you are asked to cease a behavior, do so immediately.
Arguing with the Council in public channels is unwise.

### VI. The Age of Enlightenment
This coven is strictly for those who have reached the age of majority.
If you are found to be under 18, you will be cast out until your time has come.
