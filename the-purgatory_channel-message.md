### :scroll: The Incantation of Patience
**The Gates are Shut... For Now.**
Your spirit has been bound by the seals, but the ritual is not yet complete.
Your essence now lingers in **The Threshold**, where the eyes of **The Council** weigh your worth.

Do not grow restless.
The shadows do not move for the impatient.
If your intentions are true and your path aligns with the Black Thread, the gates shall swing wide.


* **Status:** Awaiting Council Review.
* **Instruction:** Ensure your profile and presence reflect the respect required of an initiate.
* **Invitation:** If you wish to hasten your passage, share with The Council any reasons, stories, or intentions that reveal why your spirit deserves entry into The Coven. Speak your truth, but let your words be worthy of the altar.

> *"The void does not rush, and neither do the gods of the deep."*
